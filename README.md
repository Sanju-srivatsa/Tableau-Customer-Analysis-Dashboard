# Customer Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a **Customer Analysis Dashboard** using Tableau to monitor and analyze customer behavior, acquisition, retention, and overall purchasing patterns. The dashboard provides key insights into customer activity, helping businesses to understand their customers better, track customer engagement, and take actionable decisions to improve retention and increase overall sales.

## Features

1. **Key Metrics Display**:
   - **Total Customers**: Displays the total number of unique customers.
   - **New Customers**: Shows the number of customers acquired within the reporting period.
   - **Churn Customers**: Indicates the number of customers who have churned (stopped purchasing).
   - **Average Customer Purchase**: Shows the average purchase amount per customer.

2. **Customer Repeat Purchase Heatmap**:
   - This heatmap visualizes the behavior of customers' repeat purchases over time. It shows how many months after the first purchase customers make repeat purchases, with the color intensity indicating frequency.

3. **Customer Cohort Analysis**:
   - The cohort analysis groups customers based on their first purchase date and tracks their behavior in subsequent months. This is useful for understanding long-term customer retention and behavior patterns.

4. **Order Frequency Distribution**:
   - This section provides insights into how frequently customers are placing orders. It helps track customer engagement levels and frequency of repeat orders.

## Use Case
This dashboard can be used by business analysts, marketing teams, and management to:
- **Track customer acquisition** over time.
- **Identify churn patterns** and customer drop-offs.
- **Understand purchasing behavior** and trends across different customer cohorts.
- **Optimize marketing efforts** by targeting customers likely to churn.
- **Increase customer retention** by analyzing repeat purchases.

## Data Source
The data for this dashboard includes customer transaction details, including:
- Date of first purchase
- Date of subsequent purchases
- Customer churn information
- Total number of orders and average order values

## Visualizations

1. **KPIs**:
   - Quick view of critical metrics such as total customers, new customers, churn customers, and average purchase amount.

2. **Repeat Purchase Heatmap**:
   - Provides a visualization of customer behavior over time based on repeat purchase patterns.

3. **Cohort Analysis**:
   - Groups customers by the month of their first purchase and tracks their purchasing behavior over time.

4. **Order Frequency**:
   - Shows the distribution of customer order frequencies to understand customer engagement levels.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Open the Tableau Dashboard**:
   - Load the Tableau workbook in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
   
2. **Filter the Data**:
   - Use the date filters on the dashboard to view data for specific years or time periods.
   
3. **Interact with Visualizations**:
   - Explore different customer cohorts by selecting specific months in the heatmap.
   - View changes in churn rates and customer acquisition by selecting different time periods.
